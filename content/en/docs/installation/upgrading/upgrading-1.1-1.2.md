In an effort to introduce new features whilst keeping the project maintainable,
cert-manager now only supports Kubernetes down to version `v1.16`. This means
the `legacy` manifests have now been removed. You can read more
[here](../../../concepts/project-maturity/).

In this release some features have been deprecated.  Please read the [version
1.2 release notes](../../../release-notes/release-notes-1.2/) for more details
and consider whether you are using any of these deprecated features before you
proceed with the upgrade.

From here on you can follow the [regular upgrade process](../).
